# EPI Machine Learning

This project is referenced in the memo:
_**reference memo here**_

### What is this repository for?

 This repository is used to train, evaluate, and use models to predict prevalence of EPI
 in a medical claims database.  It also contains additions to the Scikit-Learn Python library
 to experiment with oversampling / undersampling techniques for large class imbalances,
 nested cross validation, metrics for use with unlabeled data, and random search for hyper-parameters
 using multiple metrics at the same time.

### **Version 0.1**

### Requirements

The `environment.yml` file describes the environment needed to run the code.  Please use:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
from Anaconda to create a compatible runtime environment for this project.

Please see [input data format](#Input-data-format) for a description of the data used to train models in this project.

### Main entry-point to use best models

Clone the repository and start using `epiml.epimlnmain.py` with data generated into a tab separated value file.
CSV files would also suffice as long as a comma (_,_) is passed into the `sep` parameter of `generate_trained_model`.

Please see `Epimlmain Example.ipynb` for an example of how to start using the library.

### Python File Descriptions
File | Description
---|---
`epimlmain.py` | Main entrypoint to train, save, load, and use models
`loadepiml.py` | Used to load data and normalize / clean it for training
`modeldeepdive.py` | Code to generate graphs and analysis / descriptions of models generated in the project
`brestmodels.py` | Hard coded model(s) with parameters found to be good during various searches for hyper-parameters
`semisuperhelper.py` | Helper code to handle unlabeled data (labeled as `-1`)
`epimlsklearn.epimlmetrics.py` | Custom scoring metrics for models using unlabled data
`epimlsklearn.frankenscorer.py` | An Sklearn scorer object that can score multiple metrics at once
`epimlsklearn.jsearch.py` | A random search of hyper-parameters using a Frankenscorer
`epimlsklearn.nestedcross.py` | A class that runs a nested cross validation search
`epimlsklearn.pnuwrapper.py` | Wraps classifiers to be used with unlabeled data PNU = *P*ositive *N*egative *U*nlabled and has mechanism for random undersampling of unlabeled data
`epimlsklearn.repeatedsampling.py` | Wraps classifiers to be used with massively unbalanced data using repeated oversampling
`epimlsklearn.rfsubsample.py` | A modified Random Forest algorithm where every bootstrapped sample used adheres to a _target imbalance ratio_, uses oversampling

### Notebook File Descriptions
File | Description
--- | ---
`Epimlmain Example` | Example code on how to use epimlmain.py
`ModelDeepDive with Model6` | Example code on how to use ModelDeepDive with _Model 6_ from the memo
`LASSO - PN and PNU` | Code to generate the LASSO baseline model using only PN (Positive and Negative) data and then a search for a model using PNU (PN + Unlabeled) data (pnuwrapper.py) which is undersampled
`SVC - PN and PNU` | Code to generate a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using only PN data and then a search for an SVC using PNU data which is understampled using pnuwrapper.py
`RF - PNU Random Search` | A nested cross validated 3x3 100 iteration search for a Random Forest (RF) classifier wrapped with PNU data which is undersampled using pnuwrapper.py.  2 different metrics are used to optimize results seperately.
`RF - PNU All Data` | Use a good performing RF model found in previous searches and test with undersampling turned off, then generate a validation curve for an undersampling parameter in pnuwrapper.py
`RF - PNU Repeated Random Subsampling Random Search` | A nested cross validated 3x3 60 iteration search for a RF using repeated random subsampling (oversampling) using all PNU data.  This notebook also contains a lot of exploration and graphs around the best model found.


### Input data format

Note that the code will run as long as there is a `Gender` column in the data along with some set of the columns below:

The input dataset used in the study had this format:

SAS Flag Name | Long Name | Description
